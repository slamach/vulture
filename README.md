# Vulture [Abandoned]

## About the Project

Simple self-hosted analytics and automation tool.

Not really working currently, but still is a nice example of full stack Node.js app written with modern technologies.

## Installation and Usage

```
npm install
```

To make the pre-commit hook work, you need to run `npm install` when the project is already initialized as a Git repository.

If the project is initialized as a repository later, you need to additionally execute `npm run prepare`.

npm start
# OR
npm run start:ui
npm run start:api
